This website is super cool in the way that you interact with it. As you scroll through you get a variety of really aesthetically pleasing fonts and colors. I think what is so successful is how smooth and easy it is to move throughout the cite, while still being able to get information.

            The website is overall really poorly designed, but the typography was no help. The designer used bright colors, flashing fonts, and several different kinds of fonts that are both ugly and boring. Also, the stark contrast and variety of content on the page makes it really difficult to keep interest.
